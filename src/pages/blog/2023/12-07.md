### Hello!

I'm writing this to no one, just wanted to get my weird thoughts on paper. The site has been refurbished to Astro (which I love so much) and now looks better than ever!

With Astro, it's just about easy to do anything static-site related. REALLY simple to do. If even a dunce like me can do all this stuff, so can you -- it's really easy to set up.

I'd probably want to talk about stuff like the [NIKKE Font Generator](https://skuqre.github.io/nikke-font-generator) and [Anis√©](https://skuqre.github.io/anise), like how they were designed, how the initial concepts of the site built up, and all that stuff.

I'd treat this place like my own personal Twitter. No bullshit Elon Musk ownership (yet) and no ruining (yet).

### Updates

Like I said, the site has been revamped on [Astro](https://astro.build), which is really easy to work with. The site may have been simple, but stuff like the [NIKKE Font Generator](https://skuqre.github.io/nikke-font-generator) is purely made in Astro as well!

Visual changes only mostly occur in color, I think I've found the golden spot I like for fonts (the font used in Bocchi the Rock for headers, plain Inconsolata for generic text) and I think it meshes well.

This was all made in a day, by the way. My workflow is unstable and will not do well in a professional environment.
