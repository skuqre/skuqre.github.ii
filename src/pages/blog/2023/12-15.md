The Blabla Interface is a game mechanic in NIKKE where you message the said Nikkes and communicate with them. Content in it can include story points and other various interactions with them. So I had to remake it.

Since the Logo Generator and Dialogue Generator have been written up in the previous post, I thought I'd make it separate here.

### Preparing

Preparation is pretty not-easy but not-hard either.

Ever since the implementation of the Narration box in the Dialogue Generator, [9-Slice images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9-slice_scaling) have been pretty much easier to create. The Narration box on the Dialogue Generator is a 9-Slice image and will scale properly when you change the canvas's width, keeping a proper margin on the left and right sides.

When looked at closely, the margin should be completely static and it shouldn't vary, all the while the Narration box looks fine.

Anyway, time to create the assets.

In the recreation, I (of course) used a 1080p screenshot to get my references. Unfortunately, all the references I've gotten has this weird grain filter overlayed over everything. My thinking is that it comes from the Lobby Background I have (SR Anis burst) but I would think that a programmer from Shift Up would not overlay said filter over everything.

It's also just about invisible to the human eye, but it really wasn't much help for my asset preparation. I had to recreate just about everything...

### Getting profile pictures

An integral part of the Blabla chat is that it has a profile picture for just about any character. I had added the image lookup feature after the release because I had gotten this suggestion from the release announcement post:

<blockquote class="reddit-embed-bq" data-embed-height="352"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NikkeMobile/comments/18f3ned/comment/kctledu/">Comment</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ANISNO1/">u/ANISNO1</a> from discussion<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NikkeMobile/comments/18f3ned/nikke_font_generator_blabla_update/"><no value=""></no></a><br> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NikkeMobile/">NikkeMobile</a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://embed.reddit.com/widgets.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

I quickly said "yeah sure after this feature is done" with "this feature" being the Chats page, or the page with all of the conversations in it. I will not be adding the latter part (the one for the Dialogue Generator) because that will inflate the repo's size; which is not what I want.

And it was so, so easy to add your favorite profile image.

How this works:
1. Upon initialization/building (I think), the site fetches a HUGE list of Nikkes from [nikke.gg](https://nikke.gg)'s Characters page. That page includes one big JSON that includes the character's name, and the image name for their specific profile picture.
2. The site then maps that to a dictionary that sets the keys as the character's name in full lowercase (e.g. `Anis: Sparkling Summer` to just `anis: sparkling summer`) and the value as its' image name.
3. When that's done, that enables the field under the "Upload Character Image" to operate on it; it uses an npm library named "fuzzysort" so that you can easily lookup your Nikkes without putting her literal name in it.

Initially when making this, I wanted to use [nikke.gg](https://nikke.gg) alone when getting both image name and image itself. CORS got mad at me and didn't allow to do so. My lord and savior [nikke-db](https://nikke-db.pages.dev) and their GitHub database repo came in to save me.

Now, when it comes to permissions, Koshirei (owner) gave me the big green light:

So we're fine... Until the folks at Nikke.gg get mad at me... (I'm using exposed API endpoints to make this feature work... <span style="font-size: 0.75rem; opacity: 0.5;">(BUT IT LOOKS LIKE A STATIC ENDPOINT TO ME SO IT SHOULDN'T TAKE A TOLL ON THEM SHOULD IT??? IDK LMAOOO)</span>)

### Creating/Release

I made it in like a day. For a beta release, it was made in just about a whole ass day. It was straight forward and quick to do, so it was done in a day. In a day. Day.

Immediately released it, thinking it'd get some attention, and it did.

<blockquote class="reddit-embed-bq" style="height:500px" data-embed-height="740"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NikkeMobile/comments/18f3ned/nikke_font_generator_blabla_update/">NIKKE Font Generator - Blabla Update</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ANISNO1/">u/ANISNO1</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NikkeMobile/">NikkeMobile</a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://embed.reddit.com/widgets.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

It got more attention than the initial release of the whole site to the public, that's for sure. Like more than twice compared to the "Blabla Update" post.

Next I had added the page with the chat list. Did something funny with it and posted a progress image on the Reddit. Holy moly did it get attention.

<blockquote class="reddit-embed-bq" style="height:500px" data-embed-height="740"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NikkeMobile/comments/18i7j95/uh_oh/">Uh oh.</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ANISNO1/">u/ANISNO1</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NikkeMobile/">NikkeMobile</a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://embed.reddit.com/widgets.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

For the next 24 hours, all the notifications I got was all about the fucking "come" being ejaculation and the Tyrant raptures being pregnant. I'm not sure how to feel about it and at this point the damage has been done

### Closing

Thank you everyone for using the tools I'm making and doing crazy stuff with it. I'm happy to see you all create your fanfictions and fantasies with it. As much as I'd like to see more, I've seen some shit as well.

It definitely is riddled with bugs and you don't want that, do you? Report it to me in the [NIKKE Community](https://discord.gg/nikke) server in the [Barely Accurate NIKKE Font Generator](https://discord.com/channels/968096627002851379/1180067857250406410) forum post, or send a message request to me in Discord (`@skuqre`). Enjoy.
