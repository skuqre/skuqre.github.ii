A simple site I made for people to create ~~fanfictions~~ images that look like a dialogue interaction from NIKKE. No hardwork needed.

I don't really know where I got this love for recreating UI from various media, but I've grown to love it a lot. I started from Discord and then learned various tricks on creating UI.

Things like
- Using multiples of 2 on values like padding and margins
- Learning how 9-Slice actually works
- How filled/outlined icons work with UI
- etc etc

It's often I use these tricks in my UI, most of my padding/margins is 4, 16, 24, and all that jabrony. But, with NIKKE Font Generator, it's a mess, but it doesn't really matter now does it?

I really was just inspired by the [GD Font Generator](https://gdcolon.com/gdfont) by GD Colon. I looked into it by simply doing Inspect Element and found out what I had to do -- do shitty JS code interacting with a simple canvas element.

### Preparing

I had the font's for the site on hand. I had it gathering up dust on my Downloads folder not sharing it with anyone.

Of course, I had to do some research to find out.

For **Pretendard**, I extracted the game's surface level files. I originally was just looking for some assets for [Anis√©](https://skuqre.github.io/anise) to use but I found the fonts extracted with the images in the output folder. Found the font that was used for majority of the game, and there we are.

For **Docteur Atomic**, I was just looking at fonts for the latter half of a night. Looked up "techno" or "sci-fi" fonts and was just scrolling through pages looking for fonts I could download. I think I found it through [here](https://www.fonts4free.net/docteur-atomic-font.html). I had noticed it was quite similar and turns out it was the same thing they used for the big "NIKKE" part of the logo. Saved it immediately after the fact.

For **Butch and Sundance**, just looked it up on [whatthefont](https://www.myfonts.com/pages/whatthefont) and kept looking after a long while. This took the most time out of everything because there was a lot of other fonts that looked quite similar.

At first, the site was using Adobe Fonts (not linking because it's Adobe) to get Pretendard for the whole site, but after finding out that the font was [free on Github](https://github.com/orioncactus/pretendard), I changed it immediately. There was a subtle change in the switch.

I think the font either got thinner or got more high-quality. What do you think?

### Creating

The first thing I made was the Logo Generator. It's the sole reason why the site is a "Font Generator."

It's not supposed to be 100% accurate and I tend to keep it that way. 

I saw someone create spoofs of the Blue Archive logo at the official Discord and I created it for responses (but I couldn't even respond to it so why even bother)

The image I was replying to:

and so it was made. In about 6 hours.

I did indeed make more terrible jokes with it (plap plap plap, and other bullshit) but it's done at this point.

Next up, Dialogue Generator!

**Genuinely** terrified of what was to become of it.

The formula was simple: just take screenshots from the game in 1080p and base it off of there. And it was-- it was that simple.

The game uses Pretendard for all of it, so no need to do preparations here. Just had to do some measurements and it's all done.

For an emergency response, I added a watermark when it went public to prevent misinfo.

It was that empty because I didn't really want to do much of it at that time. Tons of updates later and you got the UI elements that make it up.

**Risk reduction**

This is a subtopic I'd like to whine about on when/where to upload your creations from the Dialogue Generator.

> **[4-26]** I have decided to retract my statements about SHIFT UP and their assets. What I said is unethical -- as a game developer, you'd be really guarding your assets if your game is closed source. I've come to known that I was just really spoiled by the game communities I've been in before and probably expected too much. For that, I sincerely apologize.

When I learned that this was the fact, I had to put warnings **immediately** as a result.

And ofcourse, people followed suit when posting their creations to the Official Server. They mainly used fanart!

I can't really provide examples here because I can't find them. BUT, when you see someone do so, it's mainly fanart.

However, I've observed is that there's really no consequences when posting creations with assets from NIKKE-DB on the official Reddit.

<blockquote class="reddit-embed-bq" style="height:500px" data-embed-height="740"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NikkeMobile/comments/18akhfb/some_girls_if_theyre_being_honest/">some girls if they're being honest</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ThisGuyFrob/">u/ThisGuyFrob</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NikkeMobile/">NikkeMobile</a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://embed.reddit.com/widgets.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

And yes, the people did get fooled:

I always hope that when people use it, its used for fantasies and not misinfo. The differences between official and the gen is intentional.

It's pretty cool seeing my tool get used in the wild. Hehe.
