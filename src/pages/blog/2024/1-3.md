I shall now write most of the ideas in my head. Can either be a random idea or updates to BANFG.

I do this so that I could not forget of these ideas.

### GAME: Mica Rock

Ever since I got the item "Mica Rock" from the NIKKE Event, I had this idea of a rock-skipping game where you keep a rhythm to keep the rock skipping. The idea is that the rhythm would be going faster exponentially. Kinda like an actual skipping rock, but definitely not how it is in real life.

Sorta got the gameplay ideas of this from both Rhythm Doctor and a Hololive fangame, Delivering Hope.

The main idea for how the rhythm would be established is how strong you launch the rock. Launching the rock would require holding down the button and a gauge pops up. You already know the drill and it shoots the rock flying, zooming in when it's near the water and skips when you hit the spacebar right.

While I theoretically *could* make it... I don't really have a lot of time. Creating assets and all that stuff take a huge chunk of time... But it would be pretty cool I'm not gonna lie.

### BANFG: Tetragram?

This one isn't really a menu, but more of a promotional post from the Twitter account.

Before "SEA, YOU, AGAIN" I believe, the NIKKE EN Twitter posted a series of images that act like some sort of Instagram for the Ark. At first, I didn't really have the idea in my head, and it popped in just now.

No one really knows what this is called so I'm calling it Tetragram (and yet somehow Blabla was made by Missilis) since Tetra is about all things fun and awesome and Missipiss is about all things Syuen.

It'll probably look plain as hell when it releases, but who knows.

### BANFG: Commander's License

I'm just gonna copy+paste what I made from the NIKKE Community server:

All of this is still pretty much true, so /shrug

This is all of it for now.
