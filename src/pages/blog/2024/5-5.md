Barely Accurate... that's too long of a name, why not just shorten it to "Ultimate"?

### Post-3/16

After that day, I set to create the tool. I knew it was gonna be hard so I went ahead and did what I can.

#### HaxeFlixel
HaxeFlixel is an open-source 2D game engine developed by wonderful folks from the community itself. Commonly known for being used in the game Friday Night Funkin', and me having experience with "modding" Friday Night Funkin', I have sorta concluded that I'd try and use HaxeFlixel in order to do this.

However, it would seem that this path would end up in a dead end. The Spine2D version included with FlxSpine is severely outdated, and I don't want to disturb and file an issue to update the library -- so as it was, I dropped using HaxeFlixel.

Here is an **awful** looking result from this debacle (uses OpenFL, which is the more deeper part of HaxeFlixel):

The main reason why is looks so dirty is that the library being used did not support Premutliplied Alpha. [Here's a Captain Disillusion video about how horrifying the Alpha Channel is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XobSAXZaKJ8).


#### Godot
Godot is an open-source 2D and 3D game engine developed by its' community and the team. I have always wanted to learn Godot for a while now (and also because of the Unity fiasco, lmao) and when I was younger, I tried (half-assedly) to make games with it. Now however, I have had experience with Python, which is a language GDScript (the main language Godot uses) particularly looks similar too. I wanted to try it out, so I looked into it.

The installation process required a specific set of instructions that became too little complicated for my experience at the ime. Definitely not for me, as I am very new and may break something fragile when doing the said installation instructions. Decided to dropped it almost immediately after discovering the fact.

### Now (or post bargaining about which tech to use)

It's time to come back to good 'ol reliable -- JavaScript!

JavaScript has been in use for ALL of the tools in the Barely Accurate NIKKE Font Generator site -- client side JavaScript, of course. This one doesn't need that much introduction, as NIKKE Font Generator has always been JavaScript since the start.

Continuing onward, I decided to use [NIKKE-DB's Spine Player Template](https://github.com/Nikke-db/spine-web-player-template) in order to use Spine2D models from the same site. At least with this one, I know what I am doing (most of the time), so I ended up using it entirely.

#### Creating the tool

Well, this certainly isn't going to be an online tool, so I decided to use Electron, an NPM library that does what I need -- usage of web technology as an application. Think of it this way: Discord is a webapp overall, you can access it through their website, but the installed version of Discord is just an Electron app that runs Discord in it.

Now that we have that out of the way, what have I done over these past few weeks/days/months?

Ultimate is planned to be the "everything" to create NIKKE Scenarios. Transformable camera, characters, play animations of characters -- the whole shabang. I am no professional nor experienced in creating such things, but I want to learn to create these things, and the only way to begin is by beginning.

#### Spine2D

NIKKE is a game that utilizes Spine2D technology in order to provide the players with the best booty jiggle physics known to mankind. God bless the Spine Team (and the Spine Lead) especially for bringing us such wonderful sights to bestow our eyes upon. 

Anyway -- back to the point. Koshirei, wonderful person, provided a wonderful [Spine Player Template](https://github.com/Nikke-db/spine-web-player-template) for websites to use. It's pretty easy to implement, and you can just remove some UI if you need to, and nothing should really break if you try to remove some... maybe. You can just remove some of the UI, then you've just got the raw Spine player. Just implement some functions that makes them do animations and talk while they're at it. Easy peasy.

Hooray! It works, what now?

Well, to duplicate the whole damn dialogue screen again. But this time, in HTML.

We'll still be following the same way the site does it, only this time using pure HTML elements instead of a canvas element handling everything.

Yeah it was pretty easy to do that since everything from positions to sizes is just set up from the online tool. Looks accurate, doesn't it?

### Adding functionality

This is the part where I actually make the editor part of the thing.

This image is from a version far back where the code was entirely muddled out from sticks and stones and would break most of the time. That wasn't fun to work with, so I rewrote the entire thing in order for me to work with it much better.

Oh and I also added some missing bits and pieces here and there.

This is where we are now! The one you're seeing has a just about functional keyframe system, and many other stuff like downloading character assets, positioning them, and all that stuff.

Other than that, this is still very incomplete, and I'm still making stuff for it -- but I'm really excited as to what will happen when this releases.

Yup, that's a recreation of the stinger transition NIKKE has. It has sound and everything, but ShareX doesn't seem to pick it up. Anyway, that's all for now.
